# CeilingFan Functionality
## In any language, implement a simple ceiling fan with these characteristics:
### The unit has 2 pull cords:
####  One increases the speed each time it is pulled.  There are 3 speed settings, and an “off” (speed 0) setting.  
##### If the cord is pulled on speed 3, the fan returns to the “off” setting.
####  One reverses the direction of the fan at the current speed setting.
##### Once the direction has been reversed, it remains reversed as we cycle through the speed settings, until reversed again.
##  You can assume the unit is always powered (no wall switch)

###### Main.java is the main class file.
###### CeilingFan.java is the concrete class file, which holds the ceiling fan functionality.

###### Sample_output.txt is the sample output file.
